            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In Page 3. Number 7. Becauſe I have not ſufficiently explained my ſelf what I mean when I ſay, <hi>According as I have gathered from the thirty ſeventh and fifty ſecond Chapters of Jeremiah,</hi> therefore theſe following Words are to be there underſtood and annexed, <hi>viz.</hi> There is a real Danger that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> (now with them) will yet Invade and make a Conqueſt over this Nation; <hi>for though ye had Smitten the whole Army of Chaldeans which fought againſt you, and there remained but Wounded Men among them, yet ſhould they riſe up every Man in his Tent and burn this City with Fire,</hi> Jer. 37.10. And ſo may they here ſpoken of, lay this Country Deſolate; for the Judgments of God are alike againſt all Perſons, Times and Places, which commit the like Offence. Now the Sin which brought this upon <hi>Judea,</hi> was <hi>Deſpiſing and Falſification of the Oath of God;</hi> the ſame hath <hi>England</hi> been guilty of at this day: So that the ſame or like Conſequent is to be feared. And though <hi>four hundred times an hundred</hi> of the Biſhops and Clergy, with the Men pleaſing Paſtors and Teachers (who <hi>partake</hi> or <hi>conſent with the Deed of them</hi>) do Propheſie contrary or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with one conſent. They ſay <hi>Peace and Safety;</hi> they preach up <hi>Deliverance,</hi> and as if all the Danger was over; yet more is to be underſtood from that and from the following <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> there recited at length, than from the Conjecture or Obſervation of all Men living, if they were never ſo Holy or Knowing; and yet much leſs is to be allowed to the Blind Conceits and Dark Imaginations of <hi>Sinners</hi> and <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> of other <hi>corrupt</hi> Men.</p>

But what if this ſhould prove Falſe, and it ſhould ſo come to paſs, that they who uſed evil and wrong Means to <hi>ſave their Lives</hi> and Eſtates, ſhould at length <hi>loſe both their Lives</hi> and Eſtates; by firſt of all provoking, and by now drawing in upon them a Forreign and Powerful Enemy. <hi>The firſt Occaſion and Original Cauſe ſhould be looked and ſearched into;</hi> and if they are of this Mind (which indeed is not to be blamed) for every one to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to preſerve his own, then they ſhould have throughly conſidered (what perhaps they did not ſo much as ſlightly think of) <hi>How in the late Revolution, about three Years ago, they did at once ſtrike at all the Statute and Common Laws of this Kingdom, which are ſaid to be veſted in Scinio Regis.</hi> And farther, <hi>They did unhinge thoſe very Laws which do give and adjuſt to themſelves their own reſpective Honors and Eſtates, and eſtabliſh Property.</hi> And therefore <hi>Better late than never,</hi> they would do well even yet to <hi>lift the right Door again upon the Hinges.</hi> But if ye are reſolved ſtill to ſtand by the King whom ye have choſen and ſet over your ſelves, ye may find it written, <hi>And the Bramble ſaid unto the Trees, If in truth ye make me King over you, then come and put your truſt in my ſhadow,</hi> Judges 9.15.

Nay, conſider it in its other Particulars and Circumſtances, and the Protection of this new Conſtituted Governor and Government (notwithſtanding he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Kingdom with this kind of Flattery, and now Boaſts and Ingratiates with this Word) is as much inferior to the real aſſured Protection under a Rightful Governor and Government, <note place="margin">

But they now ſuffer Me to be kept here in Oppreſſion, and in a Place as it were of perpetual Impriſonment (which the Law doth not adjudge unto before Inquiry, Tryal and Conviction) to preſerve my Life as they ſay; Yet in all this they <hi>have not ſet God before them,</hi> Pſalm 86.11. nor yet do they conſider of the Superiority of his Law over their own mere Will and Conſtitutions, for I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving written the <hi>Great things of his Law, and the Words of his Righteouſneſs</hi> only, and which I do Confront to their Conſultations and Doings, if it may be truly pronounced, <hi>Id quiſque Poteſt quod de jure Poteſt;</hi> then I do boldly ſay, that they cannot take away my Life. And yet here it may be obſerved how their <hi>Tongue doth mutter Perverſneſs,</hi> and their <hi>Lips doth ſpeak forth Rebellion;</hi> for they are not only reſolved to <hi>contemn God's Word and Commandment,</hi> and to go on to do otherwiſe than that requires: But they <hi>conceive Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and would bring forth Iniquity.</hi> They would fain Act in that utmoſt Oppoſition and Perſecution thereof: <hi>For their Hearts are defiled with Blood,</hi> yea they would <hi>make haſte to ſhed the innocent Blood of him,</hi> who doth only Publiſh and ſet God's Word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment before them. But, I hope, my <hi>God doth Rebuke them</hi> with a Glimpſe and Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome Knowledge of that <hi>Endleſs Life</hi> we are all juſt entring into. And throughout
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100569:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>this <hi>God will come with Vengeance, even God with Recompence, and he will come and ſave Me.</hi> And if they ſhould preſume to take away my Life here or a Moment, He will for their thus doing, and for this Cauſe He will lay them in ſuch a Conditition for evermore, that <hi>they ſhall ſeek for Death, and Death ſhall flee from them.</hi> Herein alſo their <hi>Lips may ſpeak Lies;</hi> for there may be devices to take me off privily, as by <hi>adminiſtring ſome deadly Thing,</hi> or by the Methods of cloſe Impriſonment. But whatever they may do to excuſe themſelves before Men, yet as to God againſt whom all Sin is, and who will bring every ſecret Thing into Judgment) <hi>There is no Darkneſs nor ſhadow of Death, where the workers of Iniquity may hide themſelves.</hi> And if they are indeed reſtrained from putting Me to Death by the Sinfulneſs and Odiouſneſs of downright Murther, and alſo by ſome ſence of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Eternity. They would do well as to let this laſt Thought have its perfect Work; as for themſelves to be hereby perſwaded and actually prevailed upon to be uncorrupt and to keep themſelves from their own Iniquity. If ye would indeed look unto and ſecure your ſelves in the Future Endleſs Life, <hi>Wherefore the rather Brethren</hi> give all <hi>Diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> which cannot be done otherwiſe than by ceaſing utterly from that Sin and Tranſgreſſion, which ye have been ſo long concerned and employed in.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Upon the Reading of the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Tryal, amongſt the Memorandums there is one ſhort Abrupt Sentence — <hi>Proteſting Lords againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi> At firſt ſight hereof this following Word ſprong up, or it was rather renewed in my Heart, (for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thought thereof before) <hi>viz.</hi> As it is written after <hi>Ammon</hi> had forced his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Thamar, then</hi> Ammon <hi>hated her exceedingly, ſo that the Hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the Love wherewith he had loved her,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.15. <hi>And the Ten Horns which thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt they ſhall hate the Whore,</hi> Rev. 17.16. So in the latter Days and end of Time, it ſhall be exactly thus between the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> and the <hi>Complying Lords and Council,</hi> or of whatever Friends he accounts them now, they ſhall reciprocally <hi>hate one another;</hi> and that for the very like Reaſon, which the Spirit of God gives us to underſtand when he records it after this manner. Becauſe they have been occaſional and inſtrumental to one another of committing ſo much Sin, which contracts a proportionable Guilt, and then it is to be rendred unto them in a ſutable Puniſhment and Miſery. And ſo again, whatever he thinks of them now, it will be otherwiſe between the Proteſting Lords and Uſurper, and ſo as to the hundred and fifty one Members of the Lower Houſe, He will have the beſt Opinion and Love of them: And even himſelf will then deſire exceedingly that it had been ſo as they would have hindred it, for then all this Sin and Evil had not been.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Word of Inſtruction,</hi> which doth ariſe hence is this, even ſo to do in the midſt of Health, Life and Vigour, as ye will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And this is to <hi>Repent</hi> and undo, and unravel the whole Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord ye Rulers of</hi> Sodom, <hi>give oar to the Law of your God ye People of</hi> Gomorrah, which afterwards ſpeaks on this wiſe, <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil, learn to do well, ſeek Judgment, Relieve</hi> (that is Righten) <hi>the Oppreſſed,</hi> Iſa. 1.16.11. but if ye <hi>Refuſe</hi> and <hi>Rebel,</hi> this ſhall come upon ye, O ye Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> ye may as yet know in this your Day <hi>the things that belong unto your Peace;</hi> which includes both Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal Safety and Salvation; but at length they will <hi>be hid from your Eyes.</hi>
